# (000) Hello World

## Assignment:

Write a program to display "Hello World" to the console.

## Level:

Beginner

## Assignment Objectives:

This program designed to introduce the basic C++ program structure.

All C++ Programs have a "main" function which is the starting point for the program. 

The hashtag "#" is used to delineate a compiler directive. In this program, the "#include" directive instructs the compiler to read the file "iostream" before compiling the code in this file.

*_NOTE:_ compile using c++, not gcc

      $ c++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world

The above statement is read as; use *"c++"* to compile the source file *"hello_world.cpp"* and create the output *"hello_world"*.   



## Solution:

The solution to this problem is found in the "src" subdirectory.
