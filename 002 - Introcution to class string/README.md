# (000) Hello World

## Assignment:

Write a program to read user input, a string, and write it to the console inside of a cordial message.

Be sure to try various forms of input such as Jose, Jose Torrez, 123, Robert-H-Frost,  +12, and others. Note how the strings are read and treated by *"cin"*.

## Level:

Beginner

## Assignment Objectives:

This program designed to introduce the string class. The C++ standard library function "cin" is ued to capture console input, from the user. In this example, we capture a string, and would like to note the behavior when sentences (with spaces) are entered.

This C++ Programs has only a "main" function, as the starting point for the program. 

The C++ Standard Library functions include the string class, "cin" and "cout". Note similarity of "std::string" to a C-type such as int or char. In this case, "string" is a class in the C++ standard library, so we use the scope resolution operator, as a prefix. More about strings in a future section.

*_NOTE:_ compile using g++, not gcc.*

      $ c++ stringName.cpp -o stringName

The above statement is read as; use *"g++"* to compile the source file *"stringName.cpp"* and create the output *"stringName"*.   

You will need to make the output executable by using 

     $ chmod +x stringName

Then run your *"hello_world"* program by name

     $ ./stringName

*_NOTE:_ prefixing the program name with "./" means you want to specifically run the program found in the current directory.*



## Solution:

The solution to this problem is found in the "src" subdirectory.
