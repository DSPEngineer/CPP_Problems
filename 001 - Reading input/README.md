# (000) Hello World

## Assignment:

Write a program to read user input, an integer number, and write it to the console.

Be sure to try various forms of input such as 123, 0xbed, one, and others. Note how the values are read and determined by *"cin"*.

## Level:

Beginner

## Assignment Objectives:

This program designed to introduce the "cin" function which captures user input, from the console. In this example, we capture an integer value, to keep things simple. 

This C++ Programs has only a "main" function, as the starting point for the program. 

The C++ Standard Library provides  a variety of functions to the language. In particular, "cin" is used to read data from the console. In this program, use the __extraction operator ">>"__ to read value, an integer, from the input and save it to a variable.

*_NOTE:_ compile using g++, not gcc.*

      $ c++ ReadInput.cpp -o ReadInput

The above statement is read as; use *"g++"* to compile the source file *"ReadInput.cpp"* and create the output *"ReadInput"*.   

You will need to make the output executable by using 

     $ chmod +x ReadInput

Then run your *"hello_world"* program by name

     $ ./ReadInput

*_NOTE:_ prefixing the program name with "./" means you want to specifically run the program found in the current directory.*



## Solution:

The solution to this problem is found in the "src" subdirectory.
